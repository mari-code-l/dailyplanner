# Daily Planner
### Third Milestone Project 

<p><strong>Daily Planner </strong> is a personal web application for those who loves to organize their daily plan, 
where users can register, log-in, create, read, update, delete and search their plan</p>

<p>Inspired by my boyfriend who's very old school and who still write down his plan with the use of paper and pen. I find it difficult for me to 
see him still using the old fashioned way so I have decided to create an app with a simple, clean and user friendly design </p>
